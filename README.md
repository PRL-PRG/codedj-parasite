# Setup

    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libgit2-dev

# Future Features

These are the features that we are currently bound to implement in the order of their implementation:

- integration with (non-incremental) GitHub downloader. This will give us for projects we give it all the information required (i.e. changes and messages in commits)
- making sure the ghtorrent updater can add stuff to existing datasets all right (so that we can bring all languages together)

# Distant Future Features

These will likely happen *after* the paper deadline, but should be available for the artifact deadline if the paper gets accepted:

- user friendliness (i.e. decent commandline, encapsulation of stuff, better reporting, etc.)
- file snapshots & github linguist & cloc and other tools information (not sure this is needed for the paper)
- incremental downloading
